# ISAAC SDK

The Isaac SDK is the main software toolkit for NVIDIA robotics, and is comprised of the following:
1. Isaac Robotics Engine: A framework which allows you to easily write modular applications and
deploy them on your robots. Found in the top-level folder engine.
2. Isaac GEMs: A collection of robotics algorithms from planning to perception, most of them GPU-
accelerated. gems are found in the top-level folder packages and in engine/gems.
3. Applications: Various example applications from basic samples which show specific features to
applications that facilitate complicated robotics use cases. Applications can currently be found in
the top-level folder apps or inside packages.
